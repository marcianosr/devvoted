# Project Structure & Architecture

-   Follow Next.js patterns
-   Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js.
-   Don't use classes in React, always use functional components
-   Use type over interface for TypeScript types
-   Avoid magic numbers and define constants
-   Prefer immutability for data
-   Use functional programming style over procedural programming
-   Keep components focused and small
-   Use TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
-   Use TanStack Query Devtools for debugging
-   Use Tailwind CSS for quick layout styling
-   Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
-   Use Drizzle ORM for database queries
-   Make sure Supabase is used correctly and efficiently. Be critical in using it and prevent unnecessary queries/calls
-   Store tests in the folder next to the file with .spec.ts or .spec.tsx
