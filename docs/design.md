# New application flow

This document will describe the new 'Poll' Flow and mechanics.

## 1. Submit content

Content can be submitted by everyone. A question/challenge can be for any 'content subject'

### What is a content subject?

A content subject is a collection of tags on a question
e.g. 'Frontend, TypeScript' or 'Cloud, AWS, Docker' if the question is related to all these topics.

## 2. One question a day

The original idea was a 'channel' per guild. This means if you are in multiple guilds, you get multiple questions a day. This also meant that rankings would be separated from each-other.
To get a stronger sense of community, we want everybody playing in the same pool, so that team-ups and rankings can also happen over guilds across the entirety of Kabisa.

## 3. Determining the question of the day

The Main game master ('Marciano?') can steer in content of the day. Not on theme, but on difficulty, modifiers or question type (poll, challenge, etc)

This means that difficulty or doing a challenge is done for everyone on the same day.

1. Check for matches on daily rules (question / poll, modifiable, difficulty)
2. Check which content is not been served in the last 'x' time
3. Check the interests of the player.

Rules for a day can be:

- Question is not been done in the last 'x' time
- Question matches interest of player
- Question is a poll question

For another day it could be:

- Question has been done in the last 'x' time
- Question is a poll question

Modifiers: Time limit 'x', select inverse

or: 'Out your comfort zone day!'

- Question has not been done in the last 'x' time
- Question does not match interest of player
- Question is a poll question

## 4. Scoring for questions

(Points, coins, stats, etc)

## 5. Seasons and team play

(themes, seasons, extra ranking systems, team selections, etc)
